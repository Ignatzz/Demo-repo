    <p>Here's a sandwich making guide:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice off two slices of bread from a nice hearty loaf</li>
            <li>Put lots of things in between the slices</li>
            <li>Maybe put it in the oven if it's the kind of sandwich?</li>
            <li>Eat it, probably. </li>
        </ul>

       <p>this sandwich looks pretty good:</p>

    <p>Here's a few sweet artists that I like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Elliott Smith</li>
            <li>Baroness</li>
            <li>Tammy Wynette</li>
            <li>Sleep</li>
            <li>Dur-Dur Band</li>
     </ul>
            <p>Here's one of them - Elliott Smith - performing at the Academy Awards in 1998. He was very nervous. He lost to Celine Dion who did a song for some boat movie or something.</p>
